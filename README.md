üß© Overview

In many domains such as business intelligence, academic research, healthcare analytics, and IT operations, generating periodic or on-demand reports is a critical yet repetitive task. This project aims to automate the report generation process end-to-end, reducing time, effort, and potential for human error.

By combining powerful Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, fpdf or docx, this project extracts key insights from a dataset and compiles them into a visually appealing and readable format ‚Äî typically a PDF or Word document. It is customizable and extensible to meet the needs of various users, whether for a one-time analysis or recurring reporting tasks.

‚öôÔ∏è Features

Automated Data Loading: Supports structured data formats like CSV, Excel, or directly from a DataFrame.

Data Preprocessing: Handles null values, data types, basic filtering, and statistical summaries.

Visualization: Automatically generates relevant plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts, pie charts) to illustrate data insights.

Narrative Generation: Converts numeric summaries into readable statements that provide context and interpretation.

Report Export: Outputs the final report as a PDF or Word document, combining text, tables, and charts.

Reusable Workflow: Encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook for easy customization, demonstration, and execution.
